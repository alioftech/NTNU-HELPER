\textbf{a) Evaluation of the assignment text:}

The theory in the assignment text was good and precise, but some of the references to the documentation found on the lab was poor due to missing pages, messy documentation, missing page numbering etc.

We found it much more useful to actively use the "Additional Information" inside the AIM system.

The assignment text could be more "modularized" with more clearity in part-tasks.

\textbf{b) Evalution of the assignment:}

We have learnt the AIM basics, and how terminals has to be connected in order to make a module function in a desirable way.

This lab could have included more information and tasks regarding the logical functions in AIM. Is it possible to perphaps do some of the tasks in Structured Text (ST), if there is any way of cleaning up/hiding the lines in the overview etc.


We used approximately 14 hours, due to the first 8 hours we did not accomplish the external functions. We then decided to start all over again the week after, and then finished the lab in 6 hours.
