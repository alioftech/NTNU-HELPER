\section{Part 3: Evaluation}

\textbf{a) Evaluation of the assignment text:}

The theory in the assignment text was good and precise, and the Foundation Fieldbus documentation was also very good, as it aloud us to search for keywords in the PDF instead of going through piles of paper.

\textbf{b) Evalution of the assignment:}

We have learnt the basics of fieldbus, and how this can save costs regarding to multiple signals in one cable along with less equipment in the field.

If one disregards the signal-issue from the pressure transmitter, it was a very interesting and practical good assignment.


We used approximately 10 hours, though half of the time were used troubleshooting the signal from the pressure transmitter.

\subsection{Important note}
An important note to mention which can be dangerous to many groups, is the way the water drain hose is setup. If the drain valve is opened rapidly it will cause the hose to jump out from the drain, splashing all of the electronic components in the surrounding area. This has happened to us, but luckily no electronic were splashed, just a couple of jackets and chairs. We would recommend a hose strap or similar to keep it in place, or mentioning it as a warning in the assignment text.
