\section{Part 3}
Measuring the level of water in the tank is done by a DP-cell, measuring the differential pressure of the bottom and the top of the tank. In PDM we were able to modify this sensor by setting the range to 0-500 mBar, 0-100 $\%$. Then we did a calibration procedure by manually modifying the actual value.

The first step towards calibration, performing a zero-adjust. We then manually filled the tank so that the level glass indicated 0$\%$. We then entered "zero-like" values such as 0, 0.001, 0.0001, 0, until we were satisfied.

The second step, performing a top-adjust, manually filling the tank so that the level glass indicated 100$\%$. We then entered values such as 99.999, 100, 100.01, 99.999, 100, until we were satisfied.

Both steps were repeated until it corresponded to the entire scale, 0-100 $\%$.
