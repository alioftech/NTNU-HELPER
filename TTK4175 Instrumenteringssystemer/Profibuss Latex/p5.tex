\section{Theory}
Profibus consists of two methods, PA (Process Automation) and DP (Decentralised Peripherals). PA is used for monitoring of measuring and regulating systems. DP is used to operate sensors and actuators. Profibus contains the first, second and seventh layer of the OSI model. Profibus transmits in three different ways. Electric with transfer speeds from 9.6 kbit/s to 12 Mbit/s and a range of 100 to 1200 meters. Optical transmission with a high speed and range. MBP where both data and fieldbus power is transmitted in the same cable, long range and transfer rate of 31.25 kbit/s.

The benefits of using Profibus vs. 4-20mA appears in this system by not having to use two cables to the devices in the periphery, and connects them instead to the same bus.
