\section{Evaluation}

\textbf{Assignment text:}
The theory for this lab was very detailed and good, making it easy to teach the basics of the software, though we did prepare us by some additional reading on Profibus.

\textbf{The lab:}
Throughout this lab we learned a lot about Profibus and its benefits, along with the Siemens software. Though not having an optimal valve for the PID-task, we felt like we got the most right.

We used approximately 8 hours on this lab assignment.
