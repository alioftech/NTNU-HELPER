2. Differences between "\textbf{Control Module}", "\textbf{Control Module Type}" and "\textbf{Single Control Module}":

Planning an automation solution, you have to choose the application layer protocol, MMS or IAC.

\textbf{Control Module}: Used by MMS along with function blocks. The difference between a control module and a function block, is that the control module uses automatic code sorting of code blocks, which gives better execution performance since the code blocks are executed in the most optimized way.

\textbf{Control Module Type}: Parent directory containing all the control modules and the single control modules.

\textbf{Single Control Module}: Used by Inter Application Communication along with diagrams for communication.
