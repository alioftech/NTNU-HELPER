\section{Conclusion}

Completing the ABB lab has given us a general introduction to the tools used in conjuction with the ABB 800xA Control System. All sections were completed with focus on HSE, with real-life safety-implementations, as for example the motor: It is not possible to start before the motor is totally stopped, when the speed is 0. Indicators as flashing lights for pressurestate, temperaturestate, running, ready and stopped were also implemented in the application.

The PID controller could probably be tuned more precisely, but functioned in a satisfying way for this specific lab.
