\section{Evaluation}
The overall learning outcome was good, we got hands on experience in documentation research.
The program was very well documented and offered great troubleshooting messages, that made the programming process much easier and lab hours flew away with ease. The software was occasionally faulty and didn't want to run in offline mode, a walk around was "stepping into" the code then resuming, that seemed to fix the offline mode problems, online mode was very smooth.

We've spent 9 hours on this lab, happy with the work load and documentation.
