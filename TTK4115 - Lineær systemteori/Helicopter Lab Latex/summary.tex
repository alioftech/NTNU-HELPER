\section*{Summary}
This report documents a helicopter. In this report three methods were used to control. The objective of this report is to . Two controllers are presented such as Linear-Quadratic-Regulator ({LQR}) and Proportional-Integral-Derivatives ({PID}) controllers for controlling the linearized system of a quad helicopter



\textbf{
So, what kind of implementations would improve the system control and stability? As a starter, feedback would be the first step towards making the system more stable. Through this project we will experiment with different types of feedback controllers, both mono-variable and multi-variable control.}
